            <h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>
            <p>At TodoBlaze, we take your privacy extremely seriously. Our fundamental principle is simple: <strong>we do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data outside of your device</strong>. All your data stays locally on your device, under your complete control.</p>

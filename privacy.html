        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>TodoBlaze collects minimal data necessary for app functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Task and habit information you create</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
            <li>Usage statistics for app improvement</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>Your data is primarily stored locally on your device. If you enable iCloud sync, your data will also be stored in your personal iCloud account.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
        <p>If you enable location-based reminders, the app will access your location only when needed to trigger reminders. Location data is not stored or shared with third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Calendar Integration</h2>
        <p>With your permission, TodoBlaze can sync tasks with your device's calendar. We only access calendar data necessary for task synchronization.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Analytics</h2>
        <p>We use anonymous analytics to improve the app. This data cannot be used to identify individual users.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>TodoBlaze uses Apple's StoreKit for in-app purchases and iCloud for data sync. These services are subject to Apple's privacy policies.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>TodoBlaze does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 years of age.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Changes to Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
